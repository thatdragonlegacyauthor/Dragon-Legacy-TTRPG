          - **Encounter 2 (Medium):** A pack of **Gloomfang Wolves**, feral beasts with venomous fangs.
          - **Encounter 3 (Medium):** A **Nut Mage** and a **Nut Trooper**, organized plant creatures that defend their territory with crude magic and brute force.
          - **Boss Encounter (Hard):** The party must confront the **Blightoad**, a monstrous toad-fiend whose presence is a direct result of Rya's awakened draconic power. It is the final obstacle blocking the path to the sanctuary of Tanglewood Reach.",
