  "physical_description": "Garrick exists as a tattered, spectral echo of his former self. His body is a swirling vortex of shadowy energy, vaguely humanoid in shape, and clad in the phantom image of his blessed, silver Champion armor, now twisted and broken. His face is a grim, skull-like mask with two pinpricks of burning, hateful red light where his eyes should be.",
  "background": "Once a decorated Champion of Order, Garrick was a relentless knight who investigated his superior, Grand Inquisitor Valerius, for using void energy to create fanatical soldiers. For his loyalty to the truth, Garrick was betrayed and cast into the Void Chasm. His absolute will for vengeance bound his spirit to the world as a wraith. He despises his new, unholy existence but sees his monstrous form as a necessary evil, a tool to be used against the man who made him a monster.",
  "voice": "A cold, raspy whisper that is rarely raised above a low growl.",
