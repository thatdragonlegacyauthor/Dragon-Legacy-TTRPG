  "type": "Panther-like humanoid",
  "role": "Infiltrator/Assassin",
  "physical_description": "Lirien embodies the spirit of a jungle stalker. Her wiry, athletic body is covered in sleek, midnight-black fur, and a distinctive scar from a past hunt runs over her left eye. She is adorned with necklaces of sharp, polished teeth and wears a prominent, feathered earring that marks her as a master hunter. She wears simple, tightly bound clothing that doesn’t hinder her movement, and her hands are rarely far from the pair of perfectly balanced daggers tucked into her belt.",
  "background": "Lirien was born among the secretive Shadowpelt communities that live high in the trees of the Serpent's Maw Jungle. Her people survive by their wits, stealing from passing travelers and remaining unseen in the dense canopy. Lirien quickly proved herself a natural, learning to move silently through the trees and strike with a speed and precision that earned her the title of “Ghost Panther.” She lived her life without question until an Arcane Dominion expedition threatened to defile a sacred grove of her people. In an act of defiance, she stole a powerful, magical relic from them, hoping to sabotage their ritual. Now, hunted by the Dominion’s assassins and betrayed by a rival thief seeking to curry favor, Lirien has fled her home. Her journey is a desperate bid for survival, and the relic she carries may be the only way to save her people.",
  "voice": "A quick, sly alto that can change in a flash from a conspiratorial whisper to a charming, persuasive tone.",
