  "background": "Zael was a foundling discovered near the Void Chasm. He grew up alongside Rya in Windmark Village, a quiet and observant boy with the strange ability to instinctively sense the emotions of others. He is tormented by beautiful, comforting whispers from an unknown source, a tempting voice that promises peace at the cost of his free will. He now believes confronting his connection to the Void is the only way to protect his friends and his peaceful past.",
