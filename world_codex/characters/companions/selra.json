  "physical_description": "A gentle and serene figure. Her long, dark hair is often tied back with a simple rope, and she wears worn but meticulously clean robes. Her hands are calloused from a life spent tending to the sick. A delicate, silver amulet with the Elysian symbol hangs from her neck.",
  "background": "A healer raised in Havenwood, a village that worships Elysia as a benevolent goddess of order. Selraâ€™s faith was shattered when she witnessed the Champions of Order's brutal attack on Windmark. The cruelty of their purge was a direct contradiction to everything she had ever believed. Now, traveling with Rya, she is a lost pilgrim, struggling to reconcile her faith with the injustice she has seen. Her personal quest is to redefine what true compassion and order mean for herself.",
  "voice": "A soft, melodic soprano that is gentle and soothing, but can become sharp and commanding when she speaks of her faith or injustice.",
  "quirk": "She unconsciously clasps the silver Elysian symbol she wears around her neck when she is concerned or praying.",
  "relationships": "Views Rya as a test of her beliefs. She is curious and sympathetic to Zael's struggles but sees his connection to the void as something that needs to be cleansed.",
