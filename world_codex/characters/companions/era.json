  "type": "Astoran",
  "role": "Tidal Scrivener (Blue Mage)",
  "physical_description": "A young, curious Astoran whose bioluminescent scales are still bright and vibrant, shifting in color with her emotions. Unlike the ancient Loremaster Oris, Era is fascinated by the surface world. Her large, dark eyes are wide with a thirst for knowledge, and she carries a waterproof satchel filled with meticulously organized scrolls and inks.",
  "background": "Era was a student of Loremaster Oris, tasked with chronicling the history and prophecies of the Astoran people. However, her insatiable curiosity led her to study not just the past, but the living present. Believing that the creatures of the world were a living extension of its history, she began to secretly document their abilities, developing a unique form of magic that allowed her to replicate the skills she observed. Viewing this as a deviation from their isolationist traditions, the Astoran Conclave censured her. Now, she has ventured to the surface, seeking to compile a complete codex of Eryndor's creatures, proving to her elders that the world is a library, and every monster a book.",
  "voice": "A bright, bubbly soprano that is filled with an infectious curiosity and a rapid, almost breathless pace when she is explaining a new discovery.",
  "quirk": "Her bioluminescent scales change color based on her emotionsâ€”a trait she has not yet learned to control, making her an open book to those who pay attention. She is also constantly taking notes, sketching creatures, and muttering observations to herself.",
  "relationships": "She is the former student of Loremaster Oris, whom she respects but disagrees with on matters of tradition. She views Orin as a stoic, unreadable guardian and is fascinated by the outside world, making her a potential ally to any who can show her something new.",
  "narrative_hook": "Era's quest to document the world's creatures puts her at odds with factions who would rather see them exploited or exterminated, such as the Arcane Dominion. Her unique magical abilities may also attract unwanted attention from those who see her as a threat or a tool.",
