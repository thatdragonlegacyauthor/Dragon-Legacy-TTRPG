It has two large, muscular arms, made of solid roots and bark, and a surprisingly agile, low-to-the-ground body. Its head is a single, hard-shelled seed, and its face is a simple, childlike carving in the wood. It communicates through gestures and the subtle rustling of the leaves and glowing flowers that grow from its body.",

It has no memory of its past life, only an instinctive sense of dread at the corruption that plagues the world and a primal connection to Rya's draconic power. It is an empathic creature that communicates through simple gestures and feelings. As it grows, it may gain the power to purify corrupted locations, healing the world one step at a time.",
