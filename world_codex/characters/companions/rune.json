He is a rugged golem with a chassis of cracked and repaired steel, crudely welded together but undeniably strong. Glowing blue runes pulse across his body, a sign of the sentient soul within. His head is a single, unblinking crystalline lens, and his movements are stiff but deliberate.",
  "background": "Rune is a relic of a forgotten age, a powerful golem that lay inert in the Arcanum Vaults for centuries. When he awoke, it was not with a blank slate, but with the fragmented memories of his creator, a master artificer who lived and died before the Shattering. Rune feels a deep sense of purpose he can't quite grasp, a call to a mission lost to time. He is now hunted by a faction of lore-keepers who view a souled construct as an abomination against nature. His journey is one of self-discovery, piecing together the memories of his creator to find his own true purpose.",
