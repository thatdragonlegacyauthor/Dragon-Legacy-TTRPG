This event is widely believed to be the final, benevolent act of the Goddess Elysia, who purged the world of the chaotic and destructive Draconic Lords. Elysia's followers, the Champions of Order, have cast her as a savior and the dragons as a dangerous evil. The hero, Rya, and her companions live in a world where this history is the accepted truth. Her journey is one of self-discovery, where she will learn to harness her draconic power and seek to either embrace or reject her legacy. The themes of the campaign will explore the duality of power, the importance of companionship, and the conflict between Elysia's perceived order and the raw freedom of chaos."

Elysia's followers, the Champions of Order, have rewritten history, casting her as a savior who purged the world of draconic evil. The use of draconic power, which they consider a dangerous plague, slowly weakens her prison."

Her goal is to give Eryndor the 'gift' of silence: a perfect, eternal world without choice or change. She was sealed away by the last dragons in a ritual that caused The Shattering, and her prison is the world itself. Her consciousness now exists as a psychic signal, broadcast from her prison, amplified by her holy sites, and interpreted by her devout followers as divine will. Every major act of chaos, especially the use of draconic power, weakens the seal and allows her influence to grow, bringing the world one step closer to her perfect, silent order."
