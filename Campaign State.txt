      "chronicle": "The party's journey began in Windmark Village, which was destroyed by the Champions of Order, leading to the death of Elder Elara and forcing Rya, Zael, and the newly met Selra to flee into the Whispering Woods. They found sanctuary in Tanglewood Reach, eventually cleansing the forest's corruption by defeating the Gloomwood Heart. Their path then led them to Wyndia for the first time, an expedition that ended in a chaotic escape. During the escape, Rya's Earth lineage was violently awakened, but Zael was captured and left behind. After earning the trust of the Stonekin, they mounted a second, \nsuccessful rescue mission to Wyndia, freeing Zael from the Elysian Grand Cathedral's detention block. Their quest for power led them to the Void Chasm, where Rya successfully attuned to the Void lineage, a process which had the unexpected side effect of silencing the chaotic whispers that had been plaguing Zael's mind. They now stand at the edge of the Shattered Lands, their purpose solidified."
